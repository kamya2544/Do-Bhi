I started this project in Makeathon 6.0 organised by Microsoft Learning Student Chapter at my institute. It is a platform to provide ease to local laundramants and washermen by connecting them to the people who need services. I plan to expand my project by creating a mobile app for the same so that it is easy to access. This project aims to connect hotels, hostels, PGs, hospitals and residency societies to locally available laundry as per there convinience and time.
